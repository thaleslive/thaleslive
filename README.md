```
I'm a brazilian software developer, living in Andradas, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

I'm a veterinarian and decided to change my career when I was in my last bachelor's period. I'm currently working for [Intelbras](https://www.intelbras.com/en)

My 9-to-5 job requires me to create some web applications and IoT/embbeded systems and I learn a lot doing those softwares
After that, in my spare time, I like to go deep in some concepts about software developement and learn more about the tool I'm using (currently Go and TypeScript) and also some SwiftUI things.

I've participated in Small Animals Study Group for my bachelor's degree, I like a lot of being part of a community, and I'm always looking to help the open source community.

**Some curiosities**
* My first interaction with code and database was when I was 11 years old where a friend and I decided that we want to build a private server for a game called WyD - With your destiny, a MMORPG that we liked and want to make money. **What a wishful thinking!**
* When I was 13 years old I've looked some forums to learn C/C++/C# and didn't even realize the differences between them but copy some 'Build a calculator with C' tutorial and showed to the IT guy from my middle school. As I'm from a small town, it didn't get the attention because nobody understood a thing about it and I decided to let it go, as I think that I would be just one more "The guy who fixes PC".
* I'm all about help people achieve their best. 😃
* In my bachelor's last year I took CS50 from Harvard, and it was awesome, was the same thing that doing two bachelors at same time.
