I'm a brazilian student, living in Andradas, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

Currently finishing my **Veterinary Medicine** bachelor's degree.

I've done voluntary job at Small Animals Study Group at university, where I implemented some technology to the archaic bureaucracy system, as automated link for sign-in events with QR code, move the accounting book to online spreadsheets (Google Spreadsheets), etc.

**Some curiosities**
* My first interaction with code and database was when I was 11 years old where a friend and I decided that we want to build a private server for a game called WyD - With your destiny, a MMORPG that we liked and want to make money. **What a wishful thinking!**
* When I was 13 years old I've looked some forums to learn C/C++/C# and didn't even realize the differences between them but copy some 'Build a calculator with C' tutorial and showed to the IT guy from my middle school. As I'm from a small town, it didn't get the attention because nobody understood a thing about it and I decided to let it go, as I think that I would be just one more "The guy who fixes PC".
* I'm all about help people achieve their best. 😃
